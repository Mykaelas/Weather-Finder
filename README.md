# Weather-Finder

For this weeks project we had to create a Weather app that displayed the weather and the 5 day forecast for whatever city the user prompted. I used the openweathermap API in order to pull the weather information from other sites to make it easier for the users to access. When the user clicks the button they are able to see the date, temperature, humidity, and the wind speed for the day.

If I had more time I would have added in icons so that the user was able to see a little picture that displayed the weather for the day, such as sunny, cloudy, etc. I would have also liked to add in a function to have the boxes for the 5 day forecast appear when the button is clicked. 

Here is a link to the deployed application: https://mykaelas.github.io/Weather-Finder/
